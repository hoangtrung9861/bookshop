								<p>
									Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic recommend that parents read with their children beginning as early as infancy and continuing through elementary school years.								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Reading with your children builds warm and happy associations with books, increasing the likelihood that kids will find reading enjoyable in the future.								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Reading at home boosts school performance later on. It also increases vocabulary, raises self-esteem, builds good communication skills, and strengthens the prediction engine that is the human brain.
